Entropy-based Directed Random Walk (e-DRW)
------
e-DRW is an entropy-based pathway activity inference method based on directed random walk on two separated directed pathway networks (KEGG and PID networks) for cancer classification and prediction. It employs a larger coverage of human pathway information and robust gene-weighting method to infer pathway activites for disease classification.<br>

myEntropy
------
myEntropy is an entropy calculator tool that is designed as a proof of concept to obtain the entropy scoring of a file for file type identification. It provides features include: a list of all characters present in an input file, the hexadecimal value for the corresponding characters in the input file, tabulation of results for the percentage of each characterâ€™s frequency in the input file and the entropy values calculated from the tabulation of results.<br>
