Abstract
------
The integration of microarray technologies and machine learning methods has become
popular in predicting the pathological condition of diseases and discovering risk genes. Traditional
microarray analysis considers pathways as a simple gene set, treating all genes in the pathway
identically while ignoring the pathway networkâ€™s structure information. This study proposed an
entropy-based directed random walk (e-DRW) method to infer pathway activities. Two enhancements
from the conventional DRW were conducted, which are (1) to increase the coverage of human
pathway information by constructing two inputting networks for pathway activity inference, and
(2) to enhance the gene-weighting method in DRW by incorporating correlation coefficient values
and t-test statistic scores. To test the objectives, gene expression datasets were used as input datasets
while the pathway datasets were used as reference datasets to build two directed graphs. The withindataset experiments indicated that e-DRW method demonstrated robust and superior performance
in terms of classification accuracy and robustness of the predicted risk-active pathways compared to
the other methods. In conclusion, the results revealed that e-DRW not only improved the prediction
performance, but also effectively extracted topologically important pathways and genes that were
specifically related to the corresponding cancer types.
