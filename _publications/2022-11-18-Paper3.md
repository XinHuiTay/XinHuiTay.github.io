Abstract
------
Random walks and Shannon entropy have been studied by probability theorists for decades, and they have applications in many fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and computer science. This paper is particularly aimed (1) To apply Shannon entropy in Directed Random Walk algorithm in order to calculate the distribution value along a biological pathway,(2) To discover the interrelationship between entropy and connectivity of nodes via entropybased Directed Random Walk (e-DRW), and (3) To show the role of entropy in revealing the biological insights for a gene and a pathway in the biological network. An equation is introduced to discover the connectivity of nodes in directed graph via probability values calculated from Shannon entropy formula. A direct proof of calculation is presented using entropybased Directed Random Walk with gene expression data.
